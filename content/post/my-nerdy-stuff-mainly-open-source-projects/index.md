I am committed to open science, e.g., the open-source movement. Programming is an essential part of my academic life because techniques, skills, and practical implementation ability are crucial for a "solution-based" computational social scientist \[1]. I regularly implement and am involved in open-source real-world projects and software – crawling real-world data sets like rumors in social media and political cosponsorship behaviors, facial expression mapping confidence and its deep learning-based classification, various classic agent-based models, social network analysis models, large-scale text data cleaning and text auto-generation models, topic models and text cohesion in NLP, community detection, **[narrative recognition in massive social media posts](https://github.com/hlbao/narrative)**, bioinformatics software, classification in NLP and computational social science, and many machine learning algorithms. See my GitHub: **<https://github.com/hlbao>**, and you will easily find the repository you want (hopefully with my detailed technical report).

Also, it is interesting to find a ***[`political communication`](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10584609.2020.1784327?casa_token=-An-kZtfsnQAAAAA%3AX2a82AWccfQOBEQ1yaF5KnBXZvgvi59Cd06ZDn45Fnyrt4ac2jx6bD_B9PdXlZSrJ2x-9j96wZdtEA)*** paper doing something similar to me ([project](https://github.com/hlbao/Neuro-Evolution)) and many others (mapping the confidence level with politicians' facial expressions)...
