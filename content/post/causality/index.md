The quantitative method is always my top-priority focus in research. Causal inference is especially interesting for me beyond simple correlation or regression. Since April 2021, I plan to systematically and thoroughly read "Causality: Models, Reasoning and Inference" by Judea Pearl and "Quantitative Social Science: An Introduction" by Kosuke Imai, focusing on every single detail. I will regularly write notes about my thoughts and share themÂ **[here](https://github.com/hlbao/causality)**. Take a look!
