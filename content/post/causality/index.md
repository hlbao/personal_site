The quantitative method is always my top-priority focus in research. Causal inference is especially interesting for me beyond simple correlation or regression. As a computational social scientist, of course, I have learned them in some sense, but I believe the more profound understanding, the better. Since April 2021, I plan to systematically and thoroughly read two classic books: "Causal Inference in Statistics: A Primer" by Judea Pearl and "Quantitative Social Science: An Introduction" by Kosuke Imai, focusing on every single detail. I will regularly write notes about my thoughts and share themÂ here.

* The first step to start reading the two books is to review statistics foundations -- "Social Statistics (McGraw-Hill Series in Sociology)" by Hubert M. Blalock and "The Practice of Social Research" by Earl Babbie. (You must have learned Earl's classic textbook in your college sociology class. Recall it.)

* **Review: Honestly, these two books are kind of entry-level, not very interesting.**
