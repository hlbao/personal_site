The quantitative method is always my top-priority focus in research. Causal inference and quasi-experiments are especially interesting for me beyond simple correlation. Since April 2021, I plan to systematically and thoroughly read “Causality: Models, Reasoning and Inference” by Judea Pearl, focusing on every single detail. I will regularly write notes about my thoughts and share them **[here](https://github.com/hlbao/causality)**. Take a look!
