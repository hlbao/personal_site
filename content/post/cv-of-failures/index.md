I am committed to open science. Coding is an essential part of my academic life because techniques, skills, and practical implementation ability are crucial for a "solution-based" computational social scientist \[1]. I regularly implement and am involved in open-source real-world projects and software – crawling real-world data sets like rumors in social media, facial expression mapping confidence and its deep learning-based classification, various classic agent-based models, social network analysis models, large-scale text data cleaning and text auto-generation models, topic models and text cohesion in NLP, community detection, bioinformatics software, and many machine learning algorithms. See my GitHub: **<https://github.com/hlbao>**, and you will easily find the repository you want (hopefully with my detailed technical report).
