Classification (multiclass, multilabel, binary, non-balance...) might be the most widely-used computing technique in computational social science problems, e.g., social media post classification and user auto-labeling. We can see two lines of approaches. One is the rule-based and machine learning method, e.g., kNN, Decision Trees, and Naive Bayes. The other is the deep network-based approach. There are many fancy deep network models like bert, GPT, transformer, and attention model. I find three excellent articles:Â

I will give a tutorial at MSU Communication in Fall 2021, discussing classification and online trace data processing in computational social science from a practical perspective. Hope this talk will benefit communication researchers and myself because it definitely motivates me to recall classification algorithms, especially technical details, thoroughly and holistically. What a good opportunity! Codes and slides will be released soon.
