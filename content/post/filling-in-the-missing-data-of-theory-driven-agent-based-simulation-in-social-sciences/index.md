Smith, who pioneered the use of mathematics in biology, took an early interest in work at the Santa Fe Institute and has twice spent a week visiting there. But he has concluded that artificial Life is "basically a fact-free science." During his last visit, he recalls, "the only time a fact was mentioned was when I mentioned it, and that was considered to be in rather bad taste."*

I am a computational social scientist. I was previously within the [Artificial Life community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_life) working on Agent-based Social Simulation as my Ph.D. topic. It is a historied sub-topic of computational social science (CSS). Basically, I use computer-based evolution and simulation leveraging the techniques like social networks, machine learning, and game theory to study social dynamics by building social theory-driven agent interaction rules and investigating complexity in emergent collective behaviors (in case you are not familiar with "agent" or "agent-based models," I would suggest these materials as a gentle introduction: [My Post](https://www.carsonhlbao.com/publication/cooperation/), [Agent-based Social Simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_social_simulation), [Artificial Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_society), [Agent-based Models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model) (ABM), [Agent-based Computational Economics](http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/tesfatsi/ace.htm)). I did much work in simulation and had a good publication record in decent computer science conferences and interdisciplinary journals. However, when I grow up to be more expertized in CSS and demonstrate a deep understanding of the field after working with some social scientists from an empirical perspective, I have some new ideas.

***PURE*** simulation with assumptions based on social theories might be an elegant approach for theoretical social-physicists, evolutionary biologists, and artificial life researchers. Still, it is somewhat obsolete and has been criticized as "fact-free science" in the data-driven era. Simulation-based CSS is a term of the late 1990s to early 2000s. Lazer et al. repositioned CSS as a computational analysis of data from a digital environment (Lazer 2009). One might argue that CSS is like the "blind men and an elephant," where you might have different conclusions viewed from different perspectives. I would endeavor the data-driven perspective viewed from my training in ABM and CSS. Because many assumptions in an agent-based simulation try to be elegant and realistic by striving to be more like physics; still, it is hard to figure out whether these physics-inspired general principles essentially capture the nature of social phenomena without a data-driven empirical study or calibration/test. After all, in order to simulate a phenomenon, we might have dozens of different perspectives for building agent systems and theoretical models (aka the incoherency problem in developing social theories proposed by Watts 2017).

An agent-based simulation is a powerful technique if serving as an option in the theoretical interpretation toolbox for the analysis of unprecedented scenarios. It is especially true for now as we can deal with large dimensions of parameters with current high-performance computing powers. Nevertheless, this kind of simulation limits itself to describing dependency relationships between variables while somewhat ignoring the really fundamental social issues because it is firmly and naturally rooted in the objectivist tradition of "parameter-sociology" (Malsch 2001). Therefore, it should NOT be a "whole" picture of CSS at all. Real-world found data, like web user trace and mined online data by NLP, of course will pose a revolution in traditional social science as the previous milestones in instrumentation innovations for other subjects – like a microscope for biology. A simple choice is to harness these data capabilities with simulation and theoretical interpretations or be left behind in this research paradigm revolution. \[Note: observational data isn't perfect. Some significant weaknesses of pure observation study are confusing cause and effect, selection bias, failing to deal with confounding variables, etc. However, the weaknesses do not strip the central role of data in the big data-driven and computational paradigm revolution.] The methodology of **relying on** ABM in social simulation is "suspended in air," which is different from that of the current CSS community but echos the artificial life community. We can indeed see this fact: Viewed from methodology, objects of interests, conferences, etc., the social simulation community is fusing with artificial life and evolutionary computation communities, but CSS has been gradually more like data science and the real-world stuff (**"*computational social science is anything that's cool*" -- Matthew Salganik**). Back to the argument by Horgan at the very beginning of this post, social theory-driven agent interaction rules and theoretical simulation are pretty like the Artificial Life models, and the data in the real world is pretty like the "fact." Elegant physics-inspired assumptions, simulation, and metaphorization are full of poetry while lacking prescriptive powers. Theory and the solution-oriented, data-driven empirical study should be mainstream cornerstones aligned with social simulation (ABM), an option in the toolbox.

Currently, I am working towards a grounded research direction focusing on the **real-world issues in CSS like social media, real-world complex networks, marketing, urban science, public health, and science of science through cross-fertilizing observational (e.g., trace data), theoretical (e.g., simulation), and experimental (e.g., virtual labs) studies** and overcoming the weakness of any single component. I believe this way is a complete picture to do impactful CSS. After all, computation is a means to an end. The end has to be found in the formal social theories, social research methods and design, causal inference even prediction, etc., which remain the main melody of CSS. They are not contradictory trends but complementary (Monroe 2015).

Though I really enjoy ABM, my comfort zone – it is intuitive and fun. It can generate novel patterns through simple agent interactions based on your strong or weak assumptions (aka the macro-micro linkage issue in classic sociology). I would say that it somewhat shows a shallow kind of love of a research field if someone enters it just because "I want to do it for fun." It represents a more profound love when we are willing to spend a significant fraction of Life working on more valuable parts and studying them really, really well. In this process, we will boost our potential, leave our comfort zone, and enter the growth zone. I am willing to contribute long-term efforts and continue conducting high-quality research to cross-fertilize different methodologies with data capability.
