Okay, I will continue updating this page to include my reviews, comments, and notes when selecting the papers I like and reading them.

* West, Jevin D., and Carl T. Bergstrom. "Misinformation in and about science." *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences* 118.15 (2021).

  "Most of the research efforts and interventions examine broad, public consumption of misinformation. In this article, we turn the spotlight on science from the perspectives of Hype and Hyperbole, Publication Bias, Citation Misdirection, Fake News and Predatory Publishing, Echo Chambers, Data and Science Distortion, and Interventions. We look at the ways that misinformation can travel within science due to misaligned incentives, out-of-date publishing norms, and sociotechnical systems that concentrate attention and credit on a small subset of the literature."

  The first point is Hype and Hyperbole, which is indeed a problem. Why a paper can be widely disseminated on social networks may be more due to its novelty, interestingness, and topicality rather than its academic value. I am just curious about one interesting fact. Altmetric score is an indicator for social discussion. Some papers argue it is not related to future citation \[1], but some papers argue it is significantly associated with future citation \[2]. It is interesting to find that two contrast conclusions can be published in respected journals in the same field. I am curious whether the data set they choose significantly influences the result.

  "In a recent study, we tracked citations of papers published on the arXiv before and after journal publication (98). After controlling for article quality, we find that arXiv articles published in higher-ranked journals received more citations than articles published in lower-tier journals. This indicates that journals retain gatekeeper roles for consumers. "

  Besides this, I remember an excellent theory-construction paper by Winson Peng from two classic social perspectives: normative theory and social constructivism \[3].


  "… are cited more for rhetorical purposes, as suggested by the social constructivist approach, rather than as a form of reward, as argued by normative theory. The impact of time on citations varies across journals, which creates a growing "citation gap" for Internet studies published in journals with different characteristics …… have to depend more on the authoritative literature to "advance their interests, defend their claims against attack, convince others, and gain a dominant position in their scientific community"."

  Citation is a kind of rhetorical purpose rather than the form of reward, which implies the Mattew effect in citation growth.
