Reading papers is my daily task. They build my social insights and methodological thinking. I am also careful to read too much into prior work because it might kill my creativity. Thus, I value the paper selection -- I appreciate the work which really inspires me. I will regularly update this page to collect and include my review, comments, and random thoughts when I encounter these inspiring papers luckily. Feel free to contact me for any discussions -- Random thoughts are not formal academic articles, so be tolerant of the format :)
