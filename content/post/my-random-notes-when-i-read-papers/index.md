Reading papers is my daily task. Some of them are particularly interesting and useful -- inspiring me a lot. I will regularly update this page to include my review, comments, and random thoughts when I encounter these extraordinary papers luckily. Feel free to contact me for any discussions -- They are not formal academic articles, so be tolerant of the format :)
