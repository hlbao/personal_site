Reading papers is my daily task. Some of them are particularly interesting and useful -- inspiring me a lot. I will regularly update this page to include my review, comments, and random thoughts when I encounter these extraordinary papers luckily. Feel free to contact me for any discussions -- Random thoughts are not formal academic articles, so be tolerant of the format :)[](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sT-oseC9EVJUbXNXmLZn2tWmftyoFkYumTtr-7voH4A/edit?usp=sharing)
