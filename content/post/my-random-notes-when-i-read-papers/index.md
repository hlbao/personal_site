Reading papers is my daily task. They build my social theory-centric insights and methodological thinking. But I don't want to read too much into prior work because it might kill my creativity. Thus, I value the paper selection – I appreciate the work which really inspires me. I will regularly update this page to collect my reviews, comments, and random thoughts when I encounter these inspirational papers luckily. Feel free to contact me for any discussions – Random thoughts are not formal academic articles, so be tolerant of the format :)
