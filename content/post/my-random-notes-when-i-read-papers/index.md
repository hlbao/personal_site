Reading papers is my daily task. Some of them are particularly interesting and useful inspiring me a lot. I will regularly update this page to include my review, comments, and notes when I encounter these extraordinary papers luckily. Feel free to contact me for any discussions.

* West, Jevin D., and Carl T. Bergstrom. "Misinformation in and about science." *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences* 118.15 (2021).

"Most of the research efforts and interventions examine broad, public consumption of misinformation. In this article, we turn the spotlight on science from the perspectives of Hype and Hyperbole, Publication Bias, Citation Misdirection, Fake News and Predatory Publishing, Echo Chambers, Data and Science Distortion, and Interventions. We look at the ways that misinformation can travel within science due to misaligned incentives, out-of-date publishing norms, and socio-technical systems that concentrate attention and credit on a small subset of the literature."

The first point is Hype and Hyperbole, which is indeed a problem in academia. Why a paper can be widely disseminated on social networks may be more due to its novelty, interestingness, and topicality rather than its academic value, and this point has been validated by many empirical studies. I am just curious about this question: Is there a relationship, correlation or casuality, between the social discussion at the early stage and the paper's future citation? Altmetric score is an indicator for social discussion. Some papers argue it is not related to future citation \[1], but some articles argue it is significantly associated with future citation \[2]. It is interesting to find that two contrast conclusions can be published in respected journals of the same field. I am curious whether the data set they choose significantly influences the result.

"In a recent study, we tracked citations of papers published on the arXiv before and after journal publication (98). After controlling for article quality, we find that arXiv articles published in higher-ranked journals received more citations than articles published in lower-tier journals. This indicates that journals retain gatekeeper roles for consumers. "

Besides this, I remember an excellent theory-construction paper by Winson Peng from two classic social perspectives: normative theory and social constructivism \[3]. He designed a multilevel model to disentangle the impact between article‐ and journal‐level factors on citations (macro/micro-level is pretty cool!) and found:

"… are cited more for rhetorical purposes, as suggested by the social constructivist approach, rather than as a form of reward, as argued by normative theory. The impact of time on citations varies across journals, which creates a growing "citation gap" for Internet studies published in journals with different characteristics …… have to depend more on the authoritative literature to "advance their interests, defend their claims against attack, convince others, and gain a dominant position in their scientific community."

Citation is a kind of rhetorical purpose rather than the form of reward, which actually implies the Mattew effect in citation growth -- the rich get richer. Because widely-cited work is an excellent tool to "defend claims against attack, convince others, and gain a dominant position in the scientific community."
