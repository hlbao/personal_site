I love this field so much... I have undertaken a significant reading in computational social science/computational communication. At Winson's regular group meeting, I gave talks about various topics in computational social science, social media study, and the science of science, including [morality purity and hatred behaviors](https://www.dropbox.com/s/atmm1d8tkhca2su/Presentation_honglin.pptx?dl=0), [scientific impact measurement and innovation evaluation](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vk6l22ocikgu5n6/honglin_bao.pptx?dl=0), [the relationships between homogeneity and group outputs from social media to scientific teams](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wk23ilkyeucips1/presentation_bao.pptx?dl=0), and [link/topic communities in social networks](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qc62kegi5iqdso2/Presentationbao.pptx?dl=0).
