**Inter-discipline is the gene rooted in my research**. I'm regularly involved in meetings in different subjects including social science, computing, and biology. I gave talks about various topics in computational social science, including [novelty in biological and social systems](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ojm9fumg4x9jx6q/novelty.pdf?dl=0), [morality purity and hatred behaviors](https://www.dropbox.com/s/atmm1d8tkhca2su/Presentation_honglin.pptx?dl=0), [scientific impact measurement and innovation evaluation](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vk6l22ocikgu5n6/honglin_bao.pptx?dl=0), [the relationships between homogeneity and group outputs from social media to scientific teams](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wk23ilkyeucips1/presentation_bao.pptx?dl=0), [innovation diffusion](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ypf0j2p3q3y4p39/diffusion_honglin.pptx?dl=0), and [link/topic communities in social networks](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qc62kegi5iqdso2/Presentationbao.pptx?dl=0).
