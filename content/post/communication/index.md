I have undertaken a significant reading in computational social science/computational communication. I participated in regular meetings and gave talks about various topics in CSS, social media study, and the science of science, including diffusion models, morality purity and hatred behaviors, scientific impact measurement and innovation evaluation, the relationships between homogeneity and group outputs from social media to scientific teams, and link/topic communities in social networks.
