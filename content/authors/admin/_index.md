Hi there! My name is Honglin (Carson) Bao (he/him/his). Welcome!

I have a multidisciplinary education background in mathematics, computer science, and economics. Now I research computational social science at [MSU & BEACON](https://beacon-center.org/). I work closely with [Dr. Winson Taiquan Peng](https://comartsci.msu.edu/our-people/taiquan-winson-peng) (Communication), [Dr. Zachary Neal](https://www.zacharyneal.com/) (Psychology), the Koza Chair [Dr. Wolfgang Banzhaf](http://www.cse.msu.edu/~banzhafw/) (Computer Science), and [Dr. Misha Teplitskiy](https://sites.google.com/view/teplitskiy) at the School of Information, U-Michigan (Yeah I value research collaboration).

I am a computational scientist in training at BEACON. I previously leveraged techniques like machine learning, social networks, and game theory to build **social theory and metaphor-driven** microscopic agent rules and study emergent macro-patterns at the intersection of computing and sociology/economics, e.g., agent-based social simulation/computational economics, with [Artificial Life](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_life#:~:text=Artificial%20life%20(often%20abbreviated%20ALife,models%2C%20robotics%2C%20and%20biochemistry.>) researchers and computational/evolutionary biologists. Recently I have been drawn to ***the real-world issues in computational social science***. I have shifted to studying ***NLP- and data-driven social network/media/communication research and the sociology of science and innovation*** (aka Science of Science) with some "orthodox" social scientists and information science researchers. My goal is to produce impactful research in computational social science academia through ***cross-fertilizing observational (e.g., digital trace data), theoretical (e.g., simulation), and experimental (e.g., virtual labs and field experiments) studies.***

(Well, my research interest shift is a long story. Please check out this ***[post about my thinking](https://www.carsonhlbao.com/post/filling-in-the-missing-data-of-theory-driven-agent-based-simulation-in-social-sciences/)*** regarding "traditional" agent-based simulation and "modern" computational social science, as well as ***[the argument by the German sociologist Thomas Malsch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GkKP4thGPdAU5qYU2izLJyQOwZ8wE9OnDQeIM79VYis/edit?usp=sharing)***.)

I am active in research collaboration on the following topics. I am also committed to open science by actively contributing to open-access resources/software/data. Contact me: **baohlcs@gmail.com**
