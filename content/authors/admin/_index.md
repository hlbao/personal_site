Hi there! My name is Honglin Carson Bao (he/him/his). Welcome!

I have a multidisciplinary education background in mathematics, computer science, and economics. Now I am a Ph.D. candidate at Michigan State University & NSF BEACON Center for the Study of Evolution in Action. I work closely with [Dr. Winson Taiquan Peng](https://comartsci.msu.edu/our-people/taiquan-winson-peng) (Communication and Media Science), [Dr. Zachary Neal](https://www.zacharyneal.com/) (Psychology and Sociology), and Koza Chair Professor [Dr. Wolfgang Banzhaf](http://www.cse.msu.edu/~banzhafw/) (Computer Science).

I have strong interests in the computing realm and social/economic science realm. As a computational scientist in training at BEACON, I previously worked on social theory-driven simulation leveraging the techniques like machine learning, social networks, and game theory to study the issues at the intersection of computing and sociology/economics, e.g., social simulation and agent-based computational economics, with several [social physicists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_physics), [Artificial Life](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_life#:~:text=Artificial%20life%20(often%20abbreviated%20ALife,models%2C%20robotics%2C%20and%20biochemistry.>)/computational biology researchers, and evolutionary biologists. Recently I have been drawn to ***data-driven computational communication/social science and its real-world applications, e.g., public health and marketing.*** I have shifted to study ***NLP-based and found data-based (e.g., online user trace) social media/communication research and the sociology of science and innovation*** (aka SciSci) with some social scientists and information science researchers. My goal is to produce impactful and novel research in these fields in academia through ***cross-fertilizing observational (trace data), theoretical (simulation), and experimental (virtual labs) studies***.

(Well, my research interests change is a long story. Please check this ***[`post`](https://www.carsonhlbao.com/post/filling-in-the-missing-data-of-theory-driven-agent-based-simulation-in-social-sciences/)*** about my thinking regarding "traditional" agent-based simulation and "modern" computational social science, and I hope you enjoy it!)

I am active in research collaboration on these issues. Contact me: baohlcs@gmail.com.
