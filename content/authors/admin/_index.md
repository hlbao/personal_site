Hi there! My name is Honglin Carson Bao. Welcome!

I have a multidisciplinary education background in mathematics, computer science, and economics. Now I am a Ph.D. candidate at Michigan State University & NSF BEACON Center for the Study of Evolution in Action. I work closely with [Dr. Winson Taiquan Peng](https://comartsci.msu.edu/our-people/taiquan-winson-peng) (Communication and Media Science), [Dr. Zachary Neal](https://www.zacharyneal.com/) (Psychology), and Koza Chair Professor [Dr. Wolfgang Banzhaf](http://www.cse.msu.edu/~banzhafw/) (CSE).

I have strong interests in the computing realm and social/economic science realm. I am focusing on cutting-edge research in Multiagent Systems and Agent-based Models, (Evolutionary) Game Theory, Computational Social Sciences, Computational Communication and Social Media Study, Social Networks, Science of Science, and Complex Adaptive Systems. I worked on social theory-driven simulation to study the issues in the intersection of computing and sociology/economics, e.g., social simulation and computational economics. Recently I have been drawn to data-driven computational social science/communication science and shifted to study ***NLP-based and found data-based (e.g., online user trace) social media/communication study and the sociology of science and innovation*** (aka SciSci). My goal is to produce impactful and novel research in these fields in academia.

I am active in research collaboration on these issues. Contact me: baohlcs@gmail.com.
