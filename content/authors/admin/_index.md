Hi there! My name is Honglin (Carson) Bao. I go by Honglin, and my pronunciation is he/him.

I have a multidisciplinary education background in mathematics, computer science, economics, and evolutionary biology. In Fall 2022, I will be moving to the Organization and Behavior Unit at Harvard Business School, working closely with [Dr. Anjali M. Bhatt](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=656900). I research Organization Science and Cultural Dynamics from the perspective of complex adaptive systems. I employ a variety of quantitative methods in my research, including formal models, big data, machine learning, network analysis, and causal inference.

Prior to that, I spent several wonderful years in Michigan. I work with [Dr. Misha Teplitskiy](https://sites.google.com/view/teplitskiy) at the School of Information, U-Michigan, Ann Arbor, on Sociology of Science and Innovation. I work on several formal models studying the collective emergent norms on networks with [Dr. Zachary Neal](https://www.zacharyneal.com/) (MSU Psychology) and the Koza Chair [Dr. Wolfgang Banzhaf](http://www.cse.msu.edu/~banzhafw/) (MSU Computer Science). I also work with [Dr. Winson Taiquan Peng](https://comartsci.msu.edu/our-people/taiquan-winson-peng) (MSU Communication) on big data-driven social media studies and computational social science.

I am active in research collaboration on the following topics. Contact me: **baohlcs@gmail.com**
