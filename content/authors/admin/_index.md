Hi there! My name is Honglin (Carson) Bao (he/him). I go by Honglin - 虹霖.

I have a multidisciplinary background in mathematics, computer science, economics, and evolutionary biology. In the summer of 2022, I will be moving to the Organization Unit and D^3 Institute at Harvard Business School, working with [Drs. Anjali M. Bhatt](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=656900),[ Amit Goldenberg](https://www.amitgoldenberg.com/), and lots of smart brains. I research **"collective behavior" in social systems from the view of complex adaptive systems**. I'm particularly interested in studying topics in the context of Science, Organization, Culture, Management, and Social Media using **quantitative** methods -(agent-based) simulation models, machine learning, network analysis, causal inference - and **collaborating with experimental psychologists.**

Prior to that, I spent several wonderful years in Michigan. I work with [Dr. Misha Teplitskiy](https://sites.google.com/view/teplitskiy) at the School of Information, U-Michigan, Ann Arbor, on Sociology of Science and Innovation. I work on several simulation models studying the collective emergent norms on networks with [Dr. Zachary Neal](https://www.zacharyneal.com/) (MSU Psychology) and the Koza Chair [Dr. Wolfgang Banzhaf](http://www.cse.msu.edu/~banzhafw/) (MSU Computer Science). I also work with [Dr. Winson Peng](https://comartsci.msu.edu/our-people/taiquan-winson-peng) (MSU Communication) on big data-driven social media studies and computational social science.

I'm active in research collaboration. Contact me: **baohlcs at gmail.com**
