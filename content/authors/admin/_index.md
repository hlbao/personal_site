I have a multidisciplinary education background in mathematics, computer science, and economics. Now I am a Ph.D. candidate at Michigan State University & NSF BEACON Center for the Study of Evolution in Action. I work closely with [Dr. Taiquan Peng](https://comartsci.msu.edu/our-people/taiquan-winson-peng) (Communication and Media Science), [Dr. Zachary Neal](https://www.zacharyneal.com/) (Psychology), and Koza Chair Professor [Wolfgang Banzhaf](http://www.cse.msu.edu/~banzhafw/) (CSE).

I have fair interests in the computing realm and social/economic science realm. I am focusing on cutting-edge research in ***Multiagent Systems and Agent-based Models, (Evolutionary) Game Theory, Computational Social Sciences/Computational Communication, Social Networks, Science of Science, NLP, and Complex Adaptive Systems***. I worked on social theory-driven simulation to study the issues in the intersection of computing and sociology/communication. Recently I have been drawn to data-driven computational social science and communication science. My goal is to produce impactful and novel research in these fields in academia.
