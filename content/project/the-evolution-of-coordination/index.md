title: Evolution of Altruism (Completed)
date: 2021-03-31T00:22:24.169Z
summary: "As a leading researcher, I ask: How do coordination and altruism
  evolve from local interactions among selfish agents? I studied the evolution
  of altruism on a social network/population through reinforcement learning,
  group decision-making, behavioral mechanisms (e.g., social learning and
  reputation-based regulation), and psychological labs."
