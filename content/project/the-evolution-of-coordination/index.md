title: Evolution of Altruism (Completed)
date: 2021-03-31T00:22:24.169Z
summary: How do coordination and altruism evolve from local interactions among
  selfish agents? I studied the evolution of altruism in a population/social
  network through reinforcement learning, group decision-making, behavioral
  mechanisms (e.g., social learning, reputation-based regulation, and
  multilayered guidance), and psychological experiments.
