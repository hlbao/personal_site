date: 2021-03-31T00:22:24.169Z
summary: "As a leading researcher, I ask: How do coordination and altruism
  evolve from local interactions among selfish agents? I studied the evolution
  of altruism on social networks through reinforcement learning, group
  decision-making, and behavioral mechanisms (e.g., social learning and
  reputation-based regulation)."
