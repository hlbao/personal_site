title: Rhetoric of Science (On-going)
date: 2021-03-31T00:21:29.316Z
summary: "When you write papers, you will cite references because they inspired
  you, as [normative theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normative) states.
  You may have other references because they have rhetorical utilities, as
  [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_constructivism)shown in [social
  constructivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_constructivism). As the
  lead researcher in collaboration with [Prof. Misha
  Teplitskiy](https://sites.google.com/view/teplitskiy) at the School of
  Information, University of Michigan, we study the sociological theories in
  science by posing the following question: What roles do these two groups of
  references play, respectively?"
