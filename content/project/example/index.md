How does the opinion propagate in social networks with sparse interactions between humans? I studied the opinion dynamics with sparse interactions in an open-ended society. I investigated the opinion dynamics, structural co-dynamics, and their interplay among bounded rational agents. I was involved in an NSF funding application for this project studying the co-evolution of agent behaviors and structure on social networks.
