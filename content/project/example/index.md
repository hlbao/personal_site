As a leading researcher, I ask: How does the opinion propagate in social networks with sparse interactions between humans? Do the sparse interaction and open-endedness feature of social networks reinforce the echo chamber, opinion diversity, or neutralization in social media? I investigated the opinion dynamics, structural co-dynamics, and their interplay among bounded rational agents. I was involved in an NSF funding application for this project studying the co-evolution of bounded-rational node (agent) behaviors with continuous representations and the structure of open-ended signed networks (e.g., the Siena model) and improving the inference process of agents' decision-making through heuristic approaches.
