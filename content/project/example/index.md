summary: How does the opinion propagate in social networks with sparse
  interactions between heterogeneous bounded-rational humans? Do sparse
  interaction and the open-endedness feature of social networks reinforce the
  echo chamber, opinion diversity, or neutralization? How does the opinion
  evolution guide the co-evolution of social networks?

How does the opinion propagate in social networks with sparse interactions between heterogeneous bounded-rational humans? Do sparse interaction and the open-endedness feature of social networks reinforce the echo chamber, opinion diversity, or neutralization? How does the opinion evolution guide the co-evolution of social networks? This paper has been accepted for publication byÂ [Complex & Intelligent Systems](https://www.springer.com/journal/40747/).
