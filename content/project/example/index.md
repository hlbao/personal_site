summary: "As the lead researcher, I ask: How does the opinion propagate in
  social networks with sparse interactions between heterogeneous
  bounded-rational humans? Do sparse interaction and the open-endedness feature
  of social networks reinforce the echo chamber, opinion diversity, or
  neutralization? How does the opinion evolution guide the co-evolution of
  social networks?"
