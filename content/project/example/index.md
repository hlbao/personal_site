summary: "As a leading researcher, I ask: How does the opinion propagate in
  social networks with sparse interactions between bounded-rational humans? Do
  the sparse interaction and open-endedness feature of social networks reinforce
  the echo chamber, opinion diversity, or neutralization? How does the opinion
  evolution guide the co-evolution of social networks?"
