title: Social Inspiration in Computing
date: 2022-06-22T21:13:32.744Z
summary: I am working on a long survey paper that studies the inspiration from
  social sciences in the computing realm. How does the computing community get
  inspiration from social sciences, e.g., social choice theory, game theory,
  auction/mechanism design, agent-based social simulation, psychology/behavioral
  study, organizational sociology, and social networks?
