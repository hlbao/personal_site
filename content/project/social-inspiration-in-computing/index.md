title: Social Inspiration in Computing
date: 2021-03-31T21:13:32.744Z
summary: As a leading author, I am working on a long survey paper that studies
  the inspiration from social sciences in the computing realm. How does the
  computing community get inspiration from social sciences, e.g., social choice
  theory, game theory, auction/mechanism design, agent-based social simulation,
  psychology/behavioral study, organizational sociology, and social networks?
