abstract: >-
  Regarding the evolution of cooperation, more generally, agent-based social
  simulation, I have published several papers in decent computer science
  conferences and interdisciplinary journals. I studied the evolution of
  coordination through reinforcement learning, group decision-making, and social
  learning:


  -- with social roles and unequal payoff sharing to study the origins of inequality;


  -- with the open-endedness feature of society;


  -- with the psychological labs to investigate real-world human behaviors.
