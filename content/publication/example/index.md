abstract: Existing simulation models on opinion dynamics rarely study limited
  information accessibility, sparse interactions, and the coevolution of opinion
  and an open-ended structure. In this paper, we propose the Sparse
  COevolutionary Open-Ended (SCOOE) model. We address the sparse interaction
  limitation through extrinsic collective interaction and intrinsic observation
  based on incomplete neighborhood information. We also consider the coevolution
  of opinion and open-ended structure by studying structure-opinion co-dynamics
  when dissidents are leaving and when newcomers with novel opinions are
  joining. From an opinion dynamics perspective, we find that the proposed
  mechanisms effectively form lean and fast decision strategies to reduce
  conflicts under uncertainty. The model is robust in boosting and enhancing a
  global consensus with only small odds of extreme results. The structure
  evolves toward a small-world network. We find that an emergent dialectic
  relationship exists between community segregation and community cohesion
  viewed from a structural dynamics perspective.
