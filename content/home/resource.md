I value open science. These are my commitments to it.

* A **[data set](https://github.com/hlbao/evolutionofcommunities)** for the long-term sponsorship and co-sponsorship political behaviors on House bills among senators.
* My **[paper notes and collection](https://www.carsonhlbao.com/post/my-random-notes-when-i-read-papers/)** in the field of computational social science, including political communication & media, the science of science, networks, social data, field experiments, and so forth (a good resource and welcome discussions!).
* I am planing a tutorial-like presentation regarding the classification in computational social science ([why I do this](https://www.carsonhlbao.com/post/classification-you-are-so-important/)). So, this **[GitHub repository](https://github.com/hlbao/classification_in_CSS)** includes pretty much everything: starting from scraping twitter text data from the API, preprocessing to build a clean data set, feature selection, vector representation, and finally, classification (binary, multi-class, imbalanced/insufficient data, machine/deep learning methods, evaluation, and so forth). I hope it can benefit the community. Check them out! It is under construction, and I will update it regularly.
