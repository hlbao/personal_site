* Inspired by Princeton professor of psychology and public affairs [Dr. Johannes Haushofer](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/document/download/bed2706fd34e29822004dbe29cd00bb5.pdf/Johannes_Haushofer_CV_of_Failures%5B1%5D.pdf), here is my CV OF FAILURES -- all the money I didn't get and papers that didn't get accepted.
* At the end of 2020, I failed to get ***[NSF funding](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0hzj22s53ca9oqi/NEAL_BANZHAF_BEACON11.pdf?dl=0)*** for my project studying the co-evolution of bounded-rational node (agent) behaviors with continuous representations and the structure of open-ended signed networks (e.g., the Siena model) and improving the inference process of agents' decision-making through heuristic approaches. I was disappointed because this promising project was already in the half-stage. However, we still completed it without any fundings.
