Outside academia, I spend my spare time (though not much of it) primarily on the following stuffs:
* Japanese anime. I’m a big fan of the Dragon Ball. Because of the prior evolutionary biology background, I also enjoy the Japanese Manga series Parasyte very much.
* Sports. I love playing badminton, swimming, running, and strength training.
* Reading. History, contemporary art, and nutritional science.
* Music. Classical music (I play clarinet) and, somewhat contrastingly, rock ‘n roll. I also design tattoos for myself taking inspiration from music. Here is one of my favorite tattoos (based on Freddie Mercury, as his Rock is full of classical poetry, e.g., Bohemian Rhapsody). This piece is inspired by the cover of David Bowie's studio album, Aladdin Sane.
