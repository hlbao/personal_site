Outside academia, I spend my spare time (though not much of it) primarily on the following kinds of stuff:

* Japanese anime. I'm a big fan of the [Dragon Ball](https://en.dragon-ball-official.com/). Because of the prior evolutionary biology background, I also enjoy the Japanese Manga series [Parasyte](https://www.netflix.com/title/80191008) very much.
* Sports. I love playing badminton, swimming, running, and strength training.
* Reading. History, contemporary art, and nutritional science for strength training.
* Music. Classical music (I play clarinet) and, somewhat contrastingly, rock 'n roll. I also design tattoos for myself taking inspiration from music. [Here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/g2midsxj7ft6u6g/tattoo.png?dl=0) is one of my favorite tattoos (based on [Freddie Mercury](http://www.freddiemercury.com/en/biography), as his Rock is full of classical poetry, e.g., [Bohemian Rhapsody](https://www.classicfm.com/discover-music/latest/bohemian-rhapsody-classical-playlist/)). [This piece](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wi6yjbjyb5x4jrn/david_bowie.png?dl=0) is inspired by [the cover of David Bowie's studio album, Aladdin Sane](https://www.amateurphotographer.co.uk/technique/interviews/greatest-album-cover-photography-aladdin-sane-by-david-bowie-142479).
* I am an advocate for the LGBTQ community.
