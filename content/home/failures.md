Inspired by the Stockholm economist [Dr. Johannes Haushofer](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/document/download/bed2706fd34e29822004dbe29cd00bb5.pdf/Johannes_Haushofer_CV_of_Failures%5B1%5D.pdf), this section is my **CV OF FAILURES** – besides my accomplishments, I also talk about the papers that did not get accepted and the funding I did not get. I hope this idea can reduce survivorship bias in academia and relieve your (and my) "imposter syndrome" :)

* I failed to get NSF funding with [my collaborator](https://broad.msu.edu/profile/nairanan/) at the management department, MSU business school. We intended to apply network analysis methods and evolutionary computing approaches to improve the robustness of supply chain networks.
* I failed to get NSF BEACON funding for the project "[Co-evolutionary Stability and Behaviors in Social Networks](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0hzj22s53ca9oqi/NEAL_BANZHAF_BEACON11.pdf?dl=0)," studying the co-evolution of i) bounded-rational node (agent) behaviors with continuous representations and ii) the structure of open-ended signed networks (e.g., the Siena model), and improving the inference process of agents' decision-making through heuristic approaches.
