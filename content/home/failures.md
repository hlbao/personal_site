Inspired by the Stockholm economist [Dr. Johannes Haushofer](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/document/download/bed2706fd34e29822004dbe29cd00bb5.pdf/Johannes_Haushofer_CV_of_Failures%5B1%5D.pdf), this section is my **CV OF FAILURES** – besides my accomplishments, I also talk about the papers that did not get accepted and the funding I did not get. I hope this idea can reduce survivorship bias in academia and relieve your (and my) "imposter syndrome" :)

* I failed to get NSF funding with [my collaborator](https://broad.msu.edu/profile/nairanan/) at the management department, MSU business school. We intended to apply network analysis methods and evolutionary computing approaches to improve the robustness of supply chain networks.
* I failed to get NSF BEACON funding for the project "[Co-evolutionary Stability and Behaviors in Social Networks](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0hzj22s53ca9oqi/NEAL_BANZHAF_BEACON11.pdf?dl=0)," studying the co-evolution of i) bounded-rational node (agent) behaviors with continuous representations and ii) the structure of open-ended signed networks (e.g., the Siena model), and improving the inference process of agents' decision-making through heuristic approaches.
* In June 2021, one paper led by myself working with a sociologist and a computer scientist was rejected by a Statistical Physics and Complex Systems journal. The reviewer comment is like, "why on earth you submitted a social science paper to a physics journal?" :) We are currently resubmitting it to another place, inside the social science community. In social science, if you are a good programmer/modeler but not an expert on the context -- ***it's a bad sign***. Methodology is just the basic and you'd better be able to play with as many methods as you can. Still, systematic training in insights and domain knowledge in the substantive topic is more crucial.
