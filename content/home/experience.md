* I recently read a classic textbook titled "[Classical Social Theory and Modern Society: Marx, Durkheim, Weber](https://www.hzu.edu.in/uploads/2020/9/Classical%20Social%20Theory%20and%20Modern%20Society_%20Marx,%20Durkheim,%20Weber.pdf)." I'm thoroughly enjoying reading the history and contemporary reflections on sociology!
* As is customary during the summer, this is an ideal time for summer school training and conferences. I have been actively involved in a number of significant events related to [Science of Science](https://feb.kuleuven.be/drc/MSI/sti), [Computational Political Science](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/nulab/pacss/), [Communication](https://www.icahdq.org/page/ICA2021), [Computational Social Science](https://sicss.io/), and [Biologically-inspired Computing](https://gecco-2021.sigevo.org/HomePage).
* I will TA for an undergrad course "[CSE 232: Introduction to C++ Programming](https://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse232/index.html)" in summer 2021 and fall 2021 (gosh, my sixth/seventh round teaching this course, including two summers).
* In the second half of 2020, I mentored Xiaoqin Yan, an undergrad student at MSU Psychology on the thesis "The Correlation between Social Media Use and Self-esteem." He ~~is applying to sociology/communication science Ph.D. programs~~ is an incoming sociology Ph.D. student at NC State for Fall 2021. Congrats, Xiaoqin!
