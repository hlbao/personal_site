* During summer 2021, I will study advanced statistics within the Department of Statistics and Probability, focusing on high-dimensional probability with application to data science. It is obviously a much deeper content for the [social science scenarios](https://www.carsonhlbao.com/post/causality/). But I enjoy the challenge and hopefully it will be a good alignment and supplement.
* I will attend [ICA 2021](https://www.icahdq.org/page/ICA2021) this May. Looking forward to the talks about cutting-edge research in communication science.
* I am an experienced teaching assistant for the MSU undergrad course "CSE 232: Introduction to C++ Programming." I taught it for six semesters (including two summers). My responsibilities include lab instruction, help hours, grading C++ projects, and reviewing exams and lectures. Got feedback "Honglin is the best TA I've ever had in a computer science class," "TA was super cool and taught well enough for the material," "Honglin is the most patient TA in this semester ...... I personally prefer to attend Honglin's help room because it will not give me too much pressure."
* In the second half of 2020, I mentored Xiaoqin Yan, an undergrad student at MSU Psychology on the thesis "The Correlation between Social Media Use and Self-esteem. " He ~~is applying to sociology/communication science Ph.D. programs~~ will be an incoming sociology Ph.D. student at NC State for Fall 2021. Congrats, Xiaoqin!
