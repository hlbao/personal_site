* [A joint talk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xkFVirD6d_H80x8DqnSSbUkWofTb7IY7/view?usp=sharing) on causal inference with [Siyuan Ma](https://siyuanma.org/).
* [My recent "narrative detector" on social media posts based on Narrative/Persuasion Theory and Machine Learning.](https://github.com/hlbao/narrative)
* As is customary during the summer, this is an ideal time for summer school training and conferences. I have been actively involved in a number of significant events related to [Science of Science](https://feb.kuleuven.be/drc/MSI/sti), [Computational Political Science](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/nulab/pacss/), [Communication](https://www.icahdq.org/page/ICA2021), [Computational Social Science](https://sicss.io/), and [Biologically-inspired Computing](https://gecco-2021.sigevo.org/HomePage).
* I'll TA for an undergrad course "[CSE 232: Introduction to C++ Programming](https://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse232/index.html)" in summer 2021 and fall 2021.
* In the second half of 2020, I mentored Xiaoqin Yan, an undergrad student at MSU Psychology on the thesis "The Correlation between Social Media Use and Self-esteem." He's now a sociology Ph.D. student at NC State. Congrats, Xiaoqin!
