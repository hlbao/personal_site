* Since 2020: Remote and part-time work for Zhejiang Daily Press Group (Qianjiang Evening News). I use NLP techniques treating text as data for topic modeling and analysis, news classification, information extraction, and many other automatic tasks assisting editors and journalists in optimizing workflow and organizing large-scale archives/documents, see: https://github.com/hlbao/nlp_text_as_data.
* I am an experienced teaching assistant for the MSU undergrad course "CSE 232: Introduction to C++ Programming." I taught it for six semesters (including two summers). My responsibilities include lab instruction, help hours, grading C++ projects, and reviewing exams and lectures. Got feedback "Honglin is the best TA I've ever had in a computer science class. The instruction was always very clear and I always felt like I understood my questions after Honglin explained them. "
* In the second half of 2020, I mentored Xiaoqin Yan, an undergrad student at MSU Psychology on the thesis "The Correlation between Social Media Use and Self-esteem. " Now he is applying to sociology/communication science Ph.D. programs.
