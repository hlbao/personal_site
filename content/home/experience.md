Remote and part-time work for Zhejiang Daily Press Group (Qianjiang Evening News). I use NLP techniques treating text as data for topic modeling and analysis, news classification, information extraction, and many other automatic tasks assisting editors and journalists in optimizing workflow and organizing archives/documents, see: https://github.com/hlbao/nlp_text_as_data.
