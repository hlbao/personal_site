* I am an experienced teaching assistant for the MSU undergrad course "CSE 232: Introduction to C++ Programming." I taught it for six semesters (including two summers). My responsibilities include lab instruction, help hours, grading C++ projects, and reviewing exams and lectures. Got feedback "Honglin is the best TA I've ever had in a computer science class. The instruction was always very clear and I always felt like I understood my questions after Honglin explained them. "
* In the second half of 2020, I mentored Xiaoqin Yan, an undergrad student at MSU Psychology on the thesis "The Correlation between Social Media Use and Self-esteem. " He ~~is applying to sociology/communication science Ph.D. programs~~ will be an incoming sociology Ph.D. student at NC State for Fall 2021. Congrats, Xiaoqin!
