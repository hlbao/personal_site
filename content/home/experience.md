* Since April 2021, I plan to systematically and thoroughly read "Causality: Models, Reasoning and Inference" by Judea Pearl, focusing on every single detail. I will regularly write notes about my thoughts and share them **[here](https://github.com/hlbao/causality)**. Take a look!
* Since 2020: Remote and part-time work for Zhejiang Daily Press Group (Qianjiang Evening News). I use NLP techniques treating text as data for topic modeling and analysis, news classification, information extraction, and many other automatic tasks assisting editors and journalists in optimizing workflow and organizing large-scale archives/documents, see: https://github.com/hlbao/nlp_text_as_data.
* I am committed to open science. I regularly implement and am involved in open-source real-world projects and software -- crawling real-world data sets like rumors in social media, face expression mapping confidence and its deep learning-based classification, various classic agent-based models, social network analysis models, large-scale text data cleaning and text auto-generation models, topic models and text cohesion in NLP, community detection, bioinformatics software, and many machine learning algorithms. See my GitHub: **https://github.com/hlbao**
* I am an experienced teaching assistant for the MSU undergrad course "CSE 232: Introduction to C++ Programming." I taught it for six semesters (including two summers). My responsibilities include lab instruction, help hours, grading C++ projects, and reviewing exams and lectures. Got feedback "Honglin is the best TA I've ever had in a computer science class. The instruction was always very clear and I always felt like I understood my questions after Honglin explained them. "
* In the second half of 2020, I mentored Xiaoqin Yan, an undergrad student at MSU Psychology on the thesis "The Correlation between Social Media Use and Self-esteem. " He ~~is applying to sociology/communication science Ph.D. programs~~ will be an incoming sociology Ph.D. student at NC State for Fall 2021. Congrats, Xiaoqin!
