* I am on several lectures/festivals at **[Summer Programs in Computational Social Science](https://sicss.io/)**, a highly informative event with many great names in the field, as always.
* I will attend **[ICA 2021](https://www.icahdq.org/page/ICA2021)** this May. Looking forward to the talks about cutting-edge research in communication science.
* I will TA for an undergrad course "**[CSE 232: Introduction to C++ Programming](https://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse232/index.html)**" in summer 2021 and fall 2021 (gosh, my sixth/seventh round teaching this course, including two summers).
* In the second half of 2020, I mentored Xiaoqin Yan, an undergrad student at MSU Psychology on the thesis "The Correlation between Social Media Use and Self-esteem." He ~~is applying to sociology/communication science Ph.D. programs~~ is an incoming sociology Ph.D. student at NC State for Fall 2021. Congrats, Xiaoqin!
