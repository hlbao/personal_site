Hi there! My name is Honglin Carson Bao (he/him/his). Welcome!

I have a multidisciplinary education background in mathematics, computer science, and economics. Now I am a Ph.D. candidate at Michigan State University & NSF BEACON Center for the Study of Evolution in Action. I work closely with [Dr. Winson Taiquan Peng](https://comartsci.msu.edu/our-people/taiquan-winson-peng) (Communication and Media Science), [Dr. Zachary Neal](https://www.zacharyneal.com/) (Psychology and Sociology), and Koza Chair Professor [Dr. Wolfgang Banzhaf](http://www.cse.msu.edu/~banzhafw/) (CSE).

I have strong interests in the computing realm and social/economic science realm. As a computational scientist in training at BEACON, I previously worked on social theory-driven simulation to study the issues in the intersection of computing and sociology/economics, e.g., social simulation and agent-based computational economics, with several social physicists and [ALife](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_life#:~:text=Artificial%20life%20(often%20abbreviated%20ALife,models%2C%20robotics%2C%20and%20biochemistry.>) researchers. Recently I have been drawn to ***data-driven computational communication/social science and its real-world applications, e.g., public health and responsible data science.*** I have shifted to study ***NLP-based and found data-based (e.g., online user trace) social media/communication study and the sociology of science and innovation*** (aka SciSci) with some social scientists and information science researchers. My goal is to produce impactful and novel research in these fields in academia.

I am active in research collaboration on these issues. Contact me: baohlcs@gmail.com
