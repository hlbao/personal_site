Hi there! My name is Honglin Carson Bao (he/him/his). Welcome!

I have a multidisciplinary education background in mathematics, computer science, and economics. Now I am a Ph.D. candidate at Michigan State University & NSF BEACON Center for the Study of Evolution in Action. I work closely with [Dr. Winson Taiquan Peng](https://comartsci.msu.edu/our-people/taiquan-winson-peng) (Communication and Media Science), [Dr. Zachary Neal](https://www.zacharyneal.com/) (Psychology and Sociology), and Koza Chair Professor [Dr. Wolfgang Banzhaf](http://www.cse.msu.edu/~banzhafw/) (Computer Science).

I am a computational scientist in training at BEACON. I previously leveraged techniques like machine learning, social networks, and game theory to build **social theory-driven** micro-level agent rules and study emergent macro-patterns at the intersection of computing and sociology/economics, e.g., agent-based social simulation/computational economics, with [social physicists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_physics), [Artificial Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_life#:~:text=Artificial%20life%20%28often%20abbreviated%20ALife,models%2C%20robotics%2C%20and%20biochemistry.)/computational biology researchers, and evolutionary biologists. Recently I have been drawn to ***the real-world issues in data-driven computational social science, e.g., public health, marketing, and urban science.*** I have shifted to study ***NLP-based and found data-based (e.g., online user trace) social network/media/communication research and the sociology of science and innovation*** (aka SciSci) with some social scientists and information science researchers. My goal is to produce impactful and novel research in these fields in academia through ***cross-fertilizing observational (e.g., trace data), theoretical (e.g., simulation), and experimental (e.g., virtual labs) studies***.

(Well, my research interests change is a long story. Please check out this ***[post](https://www.carsonhlbao.com/post/filling-in-the-missing-data-of-theory-driven-agent-based-simulation-in-social-sciences/)*** about my thinking regarding “traditional” agent-based simulation and “modern” computational social science, and I hope you enjoy it!)

I am active in research collaboration. Contact me: [baohlcs@gmail.com](mailto:baohlcs@gmail.com).
