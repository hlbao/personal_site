I have a multidisciplinary education background in mathematics, computer science, and economics. Now I am a Ph.D. candidate at Michigan State University & NSF BEACON Center for the Study of Evolution in Action. I work closely with [Dr. Taiquan Peng](https://comartsci.msu.edu/our-people/taiquan-winson-peng) (Communication and Media Science), [Dr. Zachary Neal](https://www.zacharyneal.com/) (Psychology and Sociology), and Koza Chair Professor [Wolfgang Banzhaf](http://www.cse.msu.edu/~banzhafw/) (MSU CSE).



I have fair interests in the general computing realm and social/economic science realm. I am focusing on cutting-edge research in Multiagent Systems and Agent-based Social Simulation Models, Evolutionary Game Theory, Bio-inspired Computation, Computational Social Sciences/Social Networks/Computational Communication, and Complex Adaptive Systems. I worked on theory-driven simulation. Recently I have been drawn to data-driven computational social science and communication science. An example is an emerging field in computational social science, i.e., the Science of Science. My goal is to produce impactful and novel research in these fields in academia.
