* Inspired by Princeton professor of psychology and public affairsÂ [Dr. Johannes Haushofer](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/document/download/bed2706fd34e29822004dbe29cd00bb5.pdf/Johannes_Haushofer_CV_of_Failures%5B1%5D.pdf), here is my CV OF FAILURES -- all the papers that did not get accepted and the money I did not get.
