* This records my recent news. Inspired by Princeton professor of psychology and public affairs [Dr. Johannes Haushofer](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/document/download/bed2706fd34e29822004dbe29cd00bb5.pdf/Johannes_Haushofer_CV_of_Failures%5B1%5D.pdf), I want to make it as **A CV OF FAILURES** -- besides my accomplishments, I will also talk about the papers that did not get accepted and the money I did not get. I hope this idea can relieve the terrible case of survivorship bias and serious "imposter syndrome" :)
