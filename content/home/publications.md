* This records my recent news. Inspired by Princeton professor of psychology and public affairs [Dr. Johannes Haushofer](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/document/download/bed2706fd34e29822004dbe29cd00bb5.pdf/Johannes_Haushofer_CV_of_Failures%5B1%5D.pdf), I want to make it as **THE CV OF FAILURES** – besides my accomplishments, I will also talk about the papers that did not get accepted and the funding I did not get. I hope this idea can reduce survivorship bias in academia and relieve your (and my) "imposter syndrome" :)
* I failed to get NSF funding with my collaborators at the management department, business school. We intended to apply network analysis methods and heuristic approaches to improve the robustness of supply chain networks.
* I failed to get NSF BEACON funding for the project "[Co-evolutionary Stability and Behaviors in Social Networks](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0hzj22s53ca9oqi/NEAL_BANZHAF_BEACON11.pdf?dl=0)," studying the co-evolution of bounded-rational node (agent) behaviors with continuous representations and the structure of open-ended signed networks (e.g., the Siena model) and improving the inference process of agents' decision-making through heuristic approaches. I was disappointed because this project was already in the medium stage. However, we still completed it without any fundings.
